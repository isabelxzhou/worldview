This behavior yields the formation of echo chambers - environments in which an individual’s own political beliefs are repeated and amplified and dissenting opinions are screened out. 
Recent research demonstrates that social networking sites (SNS) such as Facebook or Twitter can facilitate this selection into homogenous networks. Using data from a representative nationwide online survey, papers like “Social media echo chambers and satisfaction with democracy among Democrats and Republicans in the aftermath of the 2016 US elections”  by Florian Justwan et. al. consider the degree to which respondents’ social media networks resemble virtual echo chambers. 
They then analyze the effect of these social media echo chambers on satisfaction with democracy among Democrats and Republicans in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. elections. The findings reveal that virtual echo chambers boost democratic satisfaction among Republicans but they do not have an effect on system support by self-identified Democrats. This paper is just one of many that adds to a growing literature linking online behaviors to mass attitudes about politics.
