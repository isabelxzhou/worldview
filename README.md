Worldview is a chrome extension that attempts to analyze content-curation algorithms on Twitter and boost political content that the you would not-likely click on.

This is currently a work in progress: there are unsolved bugs in the current extension that causes it to crash when attempting to publish in chrome web store. If you would like to contribute, feel free to commit to the repository.
